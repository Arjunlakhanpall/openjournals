## Abstract
Battery technology has become a cornerstone of modern energy systems, enabling advancements in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. Accurate simulation tools are critical for understanding battery pack behavior under various conditions, optimizing performance, and ensuring safety. LiSimPack is a Python-based library built upon PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling) designed to simplify the simulation of battery packs, offering users an accessible, modular, and high-performance framework.  
This paper introduces LiSimPack, outlines its architecture, highlights its capabilities, and demonstrates its application through case studies. By bridging the gap between individual cell modeling and pack-level simulations, LiSimPack empowers researchers, engineers, and educators to explore advanced battery behaviors with ease.

## Introduction
The growing demand for efficient energy storage solutions has accelerated the need for advanced battery modeling tools. While many tools focus on individual cell performance, real-world applications require understanding how cells interact within a pack. PyBaMM is a powerful library for electrochemical battery modeling, but extending its capabilities to battery packs involves significant effort.  
LiSimPack addresses this gap by providing an intuitive interface and robust features for pack-level simulations. Its primary goals include:
1. Seamless integration with PyBaMM.
2. Support for various cell configurations (e.g., series, parallel, mixed).
3. Enhanced visualization tools for pack-level performance metrics.
4. A user-friendly API for custom simulations.  

This paper explores the design, features, and use cases of LiSimPack, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize battery pack modeling.
